## Project 1: JSON Server API Testing

**Collection File:** `Project #1 API Testing - json server.postman_collection.json`

This project involves testing APIs provided by a JSON Server, which is commonly used as a mock REST API for development and testing purposes. The collection includes various endpoints to perform CRUD operations.

## Project 2: OpenCart Registration Request

**Collection File:** `project #2 Opencart Registration request.postman_collection.json`

This project focuses on automating the registration process of OpenCart, an open-source online store management system. The collection simulates user registration by sending appropriate requests to the OpenCart API.

## Project 3: SOAP API Testing (Number Conversion)

**Collection File:** `Project #3- SOAP API Testing(Number conversion).postman_collection.json`

This project demonstrates testing of a SOAP-based web service that performs number conversion. The collection includes requests to convert numbers between different formats, showcasing how to handle SOAP requests in Postman.

## Project 4: Restful Booker API Testing

**Collection File:** `Project #4 - Restful Booker API Testing.json`

This project involves testing the Restful Booker API, a RESTful service designed for testing purposes. The collection covers various endpoints related to booking management, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting bookings.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you can import the provided Postman collections into your Postman application and execute the requests against the respective APIs.

## Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of API testing concepts.
- For Project 1, a running instance of JSON Server.
- For Project 2, access to an OpenCart instance.
- For Project 3, access to the Number Conversion SOAP API.
- For Project 4, access to the Restful Booker API.

## Running the Tests

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasad291024/APIAutomation.git
Open Postman:

Launch the Postman application on your machine.

Import Collection:

Click on the "Import" button in Postman.
Select the desired collection file (e.g., Project #1 API Testing - json server.postman_collection.json) from the cloned repository.
Click "Open" to import the collection.
Set Up Environment (If Applicable):

Some collections may require specific environment variables. Set up the necessary environments in Postman.

Execute Requests:

Open the imported collection in Postman.
Select the desired request and click "Send" to execute it.
Review the response and ensure it meets the expected outcome.
