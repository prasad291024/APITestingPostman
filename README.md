## Project 1: JSON Server API Testing
**Collection File:** `Project #1 API Testing - json server.postman_collection.json`

This project involves testing APIs provided by a JSON Server, which is commonly used as a mock REST API for development and testing purposes. The collection includes various endpoints to perform CRUD operations.

## Project 2: OpenCart Registration Request
**Collection File:** `project #2 Opencart Registration request.postman_collection.json`

This project focuses on automating the registration process of OpenCart, an open-source online store management system. The collection simulates user registration by sending appropriate requests to the OpenCart API.

## Project 3: SOAP API Testing (Number Conversion)
**Collection File:** `Project #3- SOAP API Testing(Number conversion).postman_collection.json`

This project demonstrates testing of a SOAP-based web service that performs number conversion. The collection includes requests to convert numbers between different formats, showcasing how to handle SOAP requests in Postman.

## Project 4: Restful Booker API Testing
**Collection File:** `Project #4 - Restful Booker API Testing.json`

This project involves testing the Restful Booker API, a RESTful service designed for testing purposes. The collection covers various endpoints related to booking management, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting bookings.

## Project 5: Mock API Testing
**Collection File:** `Project #5 - Mock API.postman_collection.json`

This project involves testing mock APIs using Postman to simulate different API responses and behaviors. It is useful for testing API integration before actual development.

## Project 6: Data-Driven API Testing
**Collection File:** `Project #6 - Data Driven Testing.postman_collection.json`

This project focuses on data-driven API testing using Postman. It automates API tests by dynamically passing test data from external sources like CSV or JSON files.

## Project 7: E2E Scenarios - Restful Booker with Authentication
**Collection File:** `E2E Scenarios - Restful Booker with (Auth).postman_collection.json`

This project includes end-to-end testing scenarios for the Restful Booker API, incorporating authentication mechanisms. It ensures complete workflow validation for booking management.

## Getting Started
To get started with these projects, you can import the provided Postman collections into your Postman application and execute the requests against the respective APIs.

## Prerequisites
- **Postman** installed on your machine.
- **Basic understanding of API testing concepts.**
- **For Project 1:** A running instance of JSON Server.
- **For Project 2:** Access to an OpenCart instance.
- **For Project 3:** Access to the Number Conversion SOAP API.
- **For Project 4, 5, 6, 7:** Access to the respective API endpoints.

## Running the Tests
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prasad291024/APIAutomation.git
   ```

2. **Open Postman:**
   - Launch the Postman application on your machine.

3. **Import Collection:**
   - Click on the "Import" button in Postman.
   - Select the desired collection file (e.g., `Project #1 API Testing - json server.postman_collection.json`) from the cloned repository.
   - Click "Open" to import the collection.

4. **Set Up Environment (If Applicable):**
   - Some collections may require specific environment variables. Set up the necessary environments in Postman.

5. **Execute Requests:**
